# friday funkin free download pygame port
a project started because i was bored in computer science class

## build instructions
### required modules:
* pygame-ce (SPECIFICALLY ce, normal pygame might break)
* pyvidplayer2 (+ ffmpeg)
* pygame_shaders (READ BELOW)
* tween (it is literally just called tween)

you need a special version of the library 'pygame_shaders', you can find the file i modified using this [pull request link](https://github.com/ScriptLineStudios/pygame_shaders/pull/13) because i doubt its ever gonna be merged

also also! installing pygame_shaders through pip for some reason gets you an entirely different module than the one used, idk what thats about so just install manually and replace the modified file

## troubleshooting
### known issues:
* ffmpeg sometimes just straight up doesnt work correctly for certain machines
  * not much you can do about it unfortunately

if you need further assistance open an issue (preferred) or contact me on discord

## credits
* me: pretty much everything!
* hexose: offset editor and scoretext + a few ideas
* avery: lady cutout + a few ideas

## special thanks
* tyler_mon: take a wild guess
* funne: take another wild guess
